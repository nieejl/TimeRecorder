# TimeRecorder 
This application is a simple time recording tool, that saves the data locally, and has the possibility of backing it up on a server.
It uses WPF, Entity Framework, and ASP.NET Core. The vision is to have this application be a part of a larger application, that performs performance measurements, for software development projects, supporting multiple users collaborating.
The goal is to have a range of tools for development, eg. kanban board, burndown charts, story point estimation, and task distribution.
In the future, I hope to integrate with some video conference software such as Zoom.
